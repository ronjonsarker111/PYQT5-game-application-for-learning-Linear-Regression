# Linear Regression Estimator
This project is a PyQt5-based GUI application for learning linear regression through visualization and interactive controls. It allows users to generate and manipulate signals, add noise, and estimate linear regression parameters in an intuitive way.

## Features

- Generate a linear signal with user-controlled slope (`a`), intercept (`b`), and data points (`n`).
- Add noise to the signal using Gaussian or Uniform distribution.
- Interactive sliders for real-time adjustment of:
  - Signal parameters (`a`, `b`, `n`)
  - Noise properties (Mean, Sigma)
  - Histogram bin size for noise distribution.
- Visualize:
  - The initial linear signal.
  - Noisy signal and the estimated linear trend.
  - Noise and its distribution.
- Calculate and display:
  - Estimated parameters (`a`, `b`, `sigma`).
  - Errors between initial and estimated parameters.
  - Coefficient of determination (`RÂ²`).

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
- `PyQt5`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
